# MySQL-Homework - Employee Tracker

Welcome to the employee tracker! Here we have a command-line app that allows developers to view, add, and update information stored in an employee tracker database.  Using node, inquirer, and MySQL, developers are able to manipulate information stored in the database.  

## How to Use This App

The README file comes with a link to a walk-through video of how to use this app.  Before running node index.js, it is necessary to install MySQL and inquirer.
